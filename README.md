#  React Tenzies App

App that recreates the game tenzies:

1.  Roll until all dice are the same.

2.  Click each dice to freeze it at its current value between rolls.

After checking all the dice the user will see how many times did he had to roll the dice and how long did it take to complete all ten dices with the same value.
